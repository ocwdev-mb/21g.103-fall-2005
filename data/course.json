  "course_title": "Chinese III (Regular)",
  "course_description": "This is the third of the four courses (Chinese I through IV) in MIT's regular (non-streamlined) Chinese curriculum. The four make use of the textbook, _Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin_ (unpublished, but available online), to which are added various supporting materials as needs arise. The foundation level covers core grammar, linguistic culture, basic conversation, the principles of the writing system, and elementary reading. Reading is primarily in the simplified character set that is the standard on the Mainland, but also in the traditional set that is still standard in Taiwan and many overseas communities.\n\nAll four subjects in the foundation level are (Chinese I and II) or soon will be (Chinese IV) available on OCW. Students who have advanced through Chinese I and II to reach this level, as well as those entering at Chinese III, should review at least the late material in Chinese II before proceeding. To facilitate review, as well as to orient students who are new to these materials, highlights from all the units in Chinese I and II and a list of the characters formally introduced in Character lessons 1-6 are included in the [readings](/courses/21g-103-chinese-iii-regular-fall-2005/pages/readings) section of this course.\n\n### Chinese Sequence on OCW\n\nOpenCourseWare now offers a complete sequence of four Chinese language courses, covering beginning to intermediate levels of instruction at MIT. They can be used not just as the basis for taught courses, but also for self-instruction and elementary-to-intermediate review.\n\nThe four Chinese subjects provide the following materials: an online textbook in four parts, J. K. Wheatley's _Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin_; audio files of the main conversational and narrative material in this book; and syllabi and day-by-day schedules for each term.\n\n{{< tableopen >}}\n\n\n{{< theadopen >}}\n{{< tropen >}}\n{{< thopen >}}\nCHINESE\u00a0COURSES\n{{< thclose >}}\n{{< thopen >}}\nCOURSE\u00a0SITES\n{{< thclose >}}\n\n{{< trclose >}}\n\n{{< theadclose >}}\n{{< tropen >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\nChinese I (Fall 2014)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\n[21G.101/151](/courses/21g-101-chinese-i-regular-fall-2014/)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n\n{{< trclose >}}\n{{< tropen >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\nChinese II (Spring 2015)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\n[21G.102/152](/courses/21g-102-chinese-ii-regular-spring-2015/)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n\n{{< trclose >}}\n{{< tropen >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\nChinese III (Fall 2005)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\n[21G.103](/courses/21g-103-chinese-iii-regular-fall-2005)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n\n{{< trclose >}}\n{{< tropen >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\nChinese IV (Spring 2006)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n{{< tdopen >}}\n[21G.104](/courses/21g-104-chinese-iv-regular-spring-2006/)\n{{< tdclose >}}\n\n{{< trclose >}}\n\n{{< tableclose >}}\n",
